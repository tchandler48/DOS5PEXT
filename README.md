I have uploaded various changes that I have made to the GREAT DOS 5PACK
system by Mr. George Shedlock.

You will have to download the DOS 5PACK system and apply these changes
to it.

The DOSVS_Cookbook pdf is a collection of notes and comments.  Not all
of the information as been tested, yet....  However the RJE,SPF and VTPDOSVS
should be usable.  Other sections, ie, IPL etc are usable.  Will be
updating as I test code.

Please feel free to comment, contribute and trash it, It is just a hobby....

Cheers

Tom C
